The call auction period will last for 1 hour.\nOKX operates a call auction mechanism that allows you to submit buy and sell orders at your desired prices according to certain trading parameters before a new trading pair officially begins trading. The trading system processes all submissions according to call auction rules and calculates an indicative opening price based on these submissions.\nIn order to maintain an orderly market for all users and to limit disruptive trading experiences, we have decided that (1) the total value of each user’s buy orders during a call auction must not exceed 50,000 USD, and (2) during the last 5 minutes before the call auction ends, users can still place orders but cannot cancel or modify orders. Please visit\nOKX Call Auction Mechanism\nto learn more about rules.\nIn order to provide more trading information, following the end of the call auction, OKX will display the project team’s opening price at the commencement of continuous trading as the initial price of the trading chart. The project team’s opening price is provided by the token project team usually based on the valuation of the project. This project team’s opening price is displayed for information purpose only, and is not determined by the call auction mechanism, and will not impact the prices where you will execute the orders.\nProject introduction\nWhere wallets, apps, and users connect to drive UX innovation, expand the ecosystem, and guide the network toward a decentralized, permissionless future.\nAsset name: WalletConnect\nTicker: WCT\nTotal supply: 1,000,000,000\nContract: 0xeF4461891DfB3AC8572cCf7C794664A8DD927945\nCheck WalletConnect Price:\nhttps://www.okx.com/price/walletconnect-wct\nDeposit USDT\nTop up your balance to get ready for WCT/USDT spot trading:\nDeposit USDT into your OKX Account\nRisk warning:\nThe foregoing overview and information, some of which may be provided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational purposes only.
